TODO:

    BEXTChunk
        pad description field to min 64 chars with NULLs
        pad all text fields to even num of chars INCLUDING NULL TERM

    ixml
        does ixml really need to be prepended with <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
        check output of bext stuff using SetText like reserved being full of NULLs
            date/time showing they are set but are empty
                print chars to chars in string?
                    '\0' = "0"
                    try using std::string(the null terminated char array) ??
                        but what about arrays with multiple '\0's?
            maybe use a different method
        save inactive tracks but omit from print?
            for easy reactivation when dis/re-armed

    Anything WAV
        must end on even byte count
            add byte to end if data_size() is odd

    WavHeader
        total chunk sizes saved in iterable instead of hard coding + 36 as in WavHeader::set_size()
            std::vector<uint32_t> subChunkSizes ??
            more portable with bext and ixml
        rewrite to be lighter and more C-like

    RingBuffer template stuff
        wrapper class for dealing with I/O that does not require datatype usage outside of class
        so changing SR/BD is painless and doesn't require spaghetti code outside of the I/O class
        switch it all internally and just use read() and write() and get_ptr() methods or whatever
        close now but needs refactoring for actually containing I/O

    EspSDWavFile
        fix EspSDWavFile::write_header() with new getter instead of old get_header()

    filename extension stuff for when a filename is not provided
        get list of wav files
            play them alphabetically
            parse filenames and strip both extension and leading "/" and directory
    
    finish writing EspSDWavFile::_parse_filename() and clean it all up
    is i2s r/w in a task a bug or needs other core?
    is it only i2s i/o or ring buffer i/o as well?

audio input
    choose connector
        complexity vs necessity
        start with three pin mic level
            ta3m or 3.5mm
    dual ADCs per channel
        second channel at fixed -20dB or so relative to first
        auto splice and gain up if 0dBFS exceeded
        save as 32float
        come up with a catchy name for this behavior
