TODO:
    filename extension stuff for when a filename is not provided
        get list of wav files
            play them alphabetically
            parse filenames and strip both extension and leading "/" and directory
    
    FINISH EspSDWavFile::_parse_filename() and clean it all up

    is i2s r/w in a task a bug or needs other core?
    is it only i2s i/o or ring buffer i/o as well?

audio input
    choose connector
        complexity vs necessity
        start with three pin mic level
            ta3m or 3.5mm
    dual ADCs per channel
        second channel at fixed -20dB or so relative to first
        auto splice and gain up if 0dBFS exceeded
        save as 32float
        come up with a catchy name for this behavior

user options
    variable sample rate
    variable bit depth
