TODO:

    rec/stop
        start recording on TC frame boundary or better, second boundary
            pre-roll in ring buffer?
            try sizing dynamically created ring buffer as size of one frame
                time buffer cycle to frame tick
                samples per buffer is not the same as frames per buffer
                    need to time to frames per buffer for channels > 1

    parsing all metadata
        regex to locate RIFF chunks
        read chunk size and parse

    ixml
    make bwf_version a float value; e.g. 1.0?
    setter methods for +-1% sample rates
        digitizer_sample_rate, etc
    history
        is current_filename a valid parameter per spec?
    track list and tracks
        save inactive tracks but omit from print?
            for easy reactivation when dis/re-armed

    Anything WAV
        must end on even byte count
            add byte to end if data_size() is odd

    WavHeader
        total chunk sizes saved in iterable instead of hard coding + 36 as in WavHeader::set_size()
            maybe
            std::vector<uint32_t> subChunkSizes ??
            more portable with bext and ixml

    RingBuffer template stuff
        wrapper class for dealing with I/O that does not require datatype usage outside of class
        so changing SR/BD is painless and doesn't require spaghetti code outside of the I/O class
        switch it all internally and just use read() and write() and get_ptr() methods or whatever
        close now but needs refactoring for actually containing I/O

    EspSDWavFile
        fix EspSDWavFile::write_header() with new getter instead of old get_header()

    filename extension stuff for when a filename is not provided
        get list of wav files
            play them alphabetically
            parse filenames and strip both extension and leading "/" and directory
    
    finish writing EspSDWavFile::_parse_filename() and clean it all up
    is i2s r/w in a task a bug or needs other core?
    is it only i2s i/o or ring buffer i/o as well?

audio input
    choose connector
        complexity vs necessity
        start with three pin mic level
            ta3m or 3.5mm
    dual ADCs per channel
        second channel at fixed -20dB or so relative to first
        auto splice and gain up if 0dBFS exceeded
        save as 32float
        come up with a catchy name for this behavior
