TODO:

    bwf
        reserve enough meta space to write when file is done
            keep in mind sync point and track # limits

    change audio datatype to int unless 8-bit unsigned
        check sizeof(int_fast16_t) and so on on MCU
        8 bit low priority since PCM4220 is only 16-24b
        pad data for selected bit depth and add padded flag for packing
    add optional 32f conversion

    rec/stop
        start recording on TC frame boundary or better, second boundary
            pre-roll in ring buffer?
            try sizing dynamically created ring buffer as size of one frame
                time buffer cycle to frame tick
                samples per buffer is not the same as frames per buffer
                    need to time to frames per buffer for channels > 1

    ixml
        check file_set_index setter

    EspSDWavFile
        fix EspSDWavFile::write_header() with new getter instead of old get_header()

    add current device coding history

    Playback, recall, and parsing
        regex to locate RIFF chunks
        read chunk size and parse
        filename extension stuff for when a filename is not provided
            get list of wav files
                play them alphabetically
                parse filenames and strip both extension and leading "/" and directory
        finish writing EspSDWavFile::_parse_filename() and clean it all up
        is i2s r/w in a task a bug or needs other core?
        is it only i2s i/o or ring buffer i/o as well?

audio input
    choose connector
        complexity vs necessity
        start with three pin mic level
            ta3m or 3.5mm
    dual ADCs per channel
        second channel at fixed -20dB or so relative to first
        auto splice and gain up if 0dBFS exceeded
        save as 32float
        come up with a catchy name for this behavior
