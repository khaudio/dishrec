    research
    iterate

audio input
    choose connector
        complexity vs necessity
        start with three pin mic level
            ta3m or 3.5mm

user options
    variable sample rate
    variable bit depth

sd card
    sdmmc vs spi+sd
        speed
        complexity
    wav format
        lpcm
        float
        metadata
            bwf header
            bext
            open and parse existing file
        close file in sudden shutdown
            cmos battery?

possible future features
    interleaved multichannel
        ta5m connector
    different signal levels
        mic
        line
        -10
        variable inline resistance for hotter mics
    timecode output to sync older devices without dish.timecode
    wav64
    metadata magic
        reinterpret SR/BD
            1% speedup or slowdowns
            other diabolical manipulation
    dsp
        limiter
        compressor (separate from limiter)
        reference audio out 1k sine
        1k notch for device reference
        auto gain to tone
        auto gain to mic
