TODO:
    check connections to hardware
        adc mclk setting + connection/bnc

    Gracefully fail if sd card removed while recording

    Save/load wav writer instance to/from EEPROM
        or at least filename and stuff

    ixml
        make iXML::IXML::size() not call _xml_c_str() every time it sets size
        check file_set_index setter

    TimecodeBase
        Write TimecodeData struct with framerate str and dropframe flag
        Add set_format method or something like it for higher-level classes
            to autoset framerate and DF
            similar to WavMeta::WavFormatData
            maybe come up with some better class names

    Timestamp doesn't stick on odd-numbered filenames
    Apply metadata stuff at top level
        filename to scene name

    Button
        debounce in hardware
            cap/rc

    bwf
        should move BroadcastWav::set_circled(bool isCircled) to a higher level
        change filename and not scene name
        reserve enough meta space to write when file is done
            keep in mind sync point and track # limits

    rec/stop
        bool armed;
            wait for frame boundary and start recording when armed
        start recording on TC frame boundary or better, second boundary
            pre-roll in ring buffer?
    
    DataIngestor
        try sizing dynamically created ring buffer as size of one frame
            max i2s buffer size == 1024
                max i2s buffer fraction of ring buffer size if RB size is greater
                    rewrite i2s i/o if so
            time buffer cycle to frame tick
            samples per buffer is not the same as frames per buffer
                need to time to frames per buffer for channels > 1

    EspSDWavFile
        fix EspSDWavFile::write_header() with new getter instead of old get_header()

    add current device coding history

    Playback, recall, and parsing
        regex to locate RIFF chunks
        read chunk size and parse
        filename extension stuff for when a filename is not provided
            get list of wav files
                play them alphabetically
                parse filenames and strip both extension and leading "/" and directory
        finish writing EspSDWavFile::_parse_filename() and clean it all up
        is i2s r/w in a task a bug or needs other core?
        is it only i2s i/o or ring buffer i/o as well?

audio input

        complexity vs necessity
        start with three pin mic level
            ta3m or 3.5mm
    dual ADCs per channel
        second channel at fixed -20dB or so relative to first
        auto splice and gain up if 0dBFS exceeded
        save as 32float
        come up with a catchy name for this behavior
