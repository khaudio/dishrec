# dishrec

## Overview

`dishrec` is aimed to be a low-cost audio bodypack recorder with [dish.tc](http://dish.tc) integration, enabling it to receive a master timecode signal by satellite for effortless, scalable timecode synchronization.

## Notes

TODO notes can be found in `TODO.txt`.

### Self-contained

The aim is to be a self-contained recorder.  There should be no mobile app required, and arbitrary options should be based on necessecity; i.e., the user needs not to be overwhelmed with options that are not conducive to a faster and more accurate workflow.

### Scalability

Features historically unavailable to consumer-tier devices, such as timecode, now trickle down to low-budget productions, enabling even the smallest projects to accurately automate video/audio sync.  Similarly, larger productions can also utilize [dish.tc](http://dish.tc) devices to achieve perfect sync across any number of cameras or audio recorders (including `dishrec`), without the need for periodic re-jams from a local master clock.
